# UDC Codec: Industrial Asset Tagging & Classification Platform

ðŸ—‚ **Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) for Industrial Automation Systems**

## Project Purpose

This project is a toolkit and platform for organizing, tagging, automatically classifying, and understanding both new and legacy industrial automation systems and their componentsâ€”especially equipment and instruments. It leverages the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system and related standards to help engineers, asset managers, and organizations structure, migrate, and analyze their industrial asset data.

## Features

- **Automatic Classification**: Classify equipment and instruments using UDC and other standards (e.g., IEC 81346).
- **Tagging & Asset Management**: Tag and manage assets with support for both manual and automated workflows.
- **Import/Export Pipelines**: Import data from various sources and export to standardized formats.
- **Data Aggregation & Validation**: Aggregate and validate data for quality and compliance.
- **Web & CLI Interfaces**: Interact via a web portal or command-line tools.
- **Database-Backed**: Persistent storage for projects, assets, and tags.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+ (for building from source)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Make

### Building and Running (Locally)

```bash
# Build all binaries
make build

# Run the REST API server
make run-server

# Run the CLI tool
make run-cli

# Run the web portal (if separate)
go build -o bin/webserver ./cmd/webserver
./bin/webserver
```

### Docker

To build and run everything in Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will expose the web portal and API on port 8080 by default.

## Usage

### Command-Line Tools

- **udccli**  
  - `scrape`: Recursively scrape the UDC summary and save to `data/udc_full.yaml`.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli scrape
    ```
  - `lookup [code]`: Lookup a UDC code in the local database.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli lookup 621.3
    ```
  - `addendum list`: List all addendum files.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli addendum list
    ```
  - `addendum create [filename] [code] [title]`: Create a new addendum file.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli addendum create company 999.1 "Company Classifications"
    ```
  - `addendum add [filename] [code] [title]`: Add to existing addendum file.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli addendum add company 999.1.1 "Proprietary Equipment"
    ```
  - `addendum delete [filename]`: Delete an addendum file.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli addendum delete company
    ```

- **server**  
  REST API for tag management.
  - Start:  
    ```bash
    ./bin/server
    ```
  - Endpoints:
    - `GET /tags/{tag}`: Lookup a tag.
    - `POST /tags`: Insert a new tag (JSON body).

- **webserver**  
  Web portal for browsing, uploading BOM files, and managing tags.
  - Start:  
    ```bash
    ./bin/webserver
    ```
  - Access via browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

- **autopipeline**  
  Automated pipeline for validating and exporting tag lists from BOM and aggregated data.
  - Start:  
    ```bash
    ./bin/autopipeline
    ```
  - Expects input files in `data/` (e.g., `project_bom.yaml`, `aggregated_master.yaml`).

## CLI Usage

The `udccli` tool provides command-line access to UDC functionality:

```bash
# Scrape UDC data from the official website
./bin/udccli scrape

# Look up a classification by code
./bin/udccli lookup 621.3

# Look up a classification by title (fuzzy search)
./bin/udccli lookup "electrical engineering"

# Manage addendum files
./bin/udccli addendum list                    # List all addendum files
./bin/udccli addendum add 999.1 "Custom Code" # Add to default addendum
./bin/udccli addendum add 999.2 "Another" project # Add to specific addendum
./bin/udccli addendum delete project          # Delete an addendum file
```

### Addendum Management

Addendums allow you to add custom UDC classifications that are loaded alongside the base UDC data:

- **Default addendum**: If no filename is specified, classifications are added to `udc_addendum_default.yaml`
- **Custom addendums**: Specify a filename to create or modify a specific addendum file
- **Filename format**: Files are automatically prefixed with `udc_addendum_` and suffixed with `.yaml`
- **Validation**: Addendums cannot override existing UDC codes from the base classification

---

## Data & Configuration

- Place your data files (BOMs, UDC YAML, etc.) in the `data/` directory.
- The database file (`tags.db`) is used for persistent tag storage.

### UDC Addendum System

The platform supports local addendums to the UDC classification system:

- **`data/udc_full.yaml`**: The main UDC data file (updated only by scraping)
- **`data/udc_addendum_*.yaml`**: Local addendum files for custom classifications

#### Addendum Behavior

- **New codes only**: Addendum codes must be unique and cannot overlap with existing UDC codes
- **No overrides**: Addendums cannot modify or override existing UDC classifications
- **Children**: Addendum children are added as new codes under existing classifications
- **Multiple files**: All addendum files are loaded and merged
- **Validation**: The system will reject addendum files containing overlapping codes

#### Addendum File Format

Create files named `udc_addendum_*.yaml` in the `data/` directory:

```yaml
# Example: Adding new local classifications (valid)
- code: "621.3.001"
  title: "Local Electronics Classification"
  children:
    - code: "621.3.001.1"
      title: "Custom Circuit Design"

# Example: Adding completely new local classifications (valid)
- code: "999.1"
  title: "Local Company Classifications"
  children:
    - code: "999.1.1"
      title: "Proprietary Equipment"

# Example: Adding children to existing classifications (valid)
- code: "621.3.LOCAL"
  title: "Local Electrical Engineering Topics"
  children:
    - code: "621.3.LOCAL.1"
      title: "Company-Specific Electrical Systems"

# INVALID: Overriding existing UDC codes (will cause error)
# - code: "004"
#   title: "Computer Science and Technology (Local Enhancement)"
```

#### Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `udc_addendum_company.yaml`)
- Keep addendums focused on specific domains or use cases
- Document the purpose of each addendum file
- Test addendums before deploying to production
