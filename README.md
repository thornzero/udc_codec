# UDC Codec: Industrial Asset Tagging & Classification Platform

ðŸ—‚ **Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) for Industrial Automation Systems**

## Project Purpose

This project is a toolkit and platform for organizing, tagging, automatically classifying, and understanding both new and legacy industrial automation systems and their componentsâ€”especially equipment and instruments. It leverages the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system and related standards to help engineers, asset managers, and organizations structure, migrate, and analyze their industrial asset data.

## Features

- **Automatic Classification**: Classify equipment and instruments using UDC and other standards (e.g., IEC 81346).
- **Tagging & Asset Management**: Tag and manage assets with support for both manual and automated workflows.
- **Import/Export Pipelines**: Import data from various sources and export to standardized formats.
- **Data Aggregation & Validation**: Aggregate and validate data for quality and compliance.
- **Web & CLI Interfaces**: Interact via a web portal or command-line tools.
- **Database-Backed**: Persistent storage for projects, assets, and tags.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+ (for building from source)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Make

### Building and Running (Locally)

```bash
# Build all binaries
make build

# Run the REST API server
make run-server

# Run the CLI tool
make run-cli

# Run the web portal (if separate)
go build -o bin/webserver ./cmd/webserver
./bin/webserver
```

### Docker

To build and run everything in Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will expose the web portal and API on port 8080 by default.

## Usage

### Command-Line Tools

- **udccli**  
  - `scrape`: Recursively scrape the UDC summary and save to `data/udc_full.yaml`.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli scrape
    ```
  - `lookup [code]`: Lookup a UDC code in the local database.
    ```bash
    ./bin/udccli lookup 621.3
    ```

- **server**  
  REST API for tag management.
  - Start:  
    ```bash
    ./bin/server
    ```
  - Endpoints:
    - `GET /tags/{tag}`: Lookup a tag.
    - `POST /tags`: Insert a new tag (JSON body).

- **webserver**  
  Web portal for browsing, uploading BOM files, and managing tags.
  - Start:  
    ```bash
    ./bin/webserver
    ```
  - Access via browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

- **autopipeline**  
  Automated pipeline for validating and exporting tag lists from BOM and aggregated data.
  - Start:  
    ```bash
    ./bin/autopipeline
    ```
  - Expects input files in `data/` (e.g., `project_bom.yaml`, `aggregated_master.yaml`).

---

## Data & Configuration

- Place your data files (BOMs, UDC YAML, etc.) in the `data/` directory.
- The database file (`tags.db`) is used for persistent tag storage.

## Contributing & Next Steps

This README is a work in progress. As the codebase evolves, please update usage instructions and setup steps. See the Makefile and Dockerfile for more advanced options.
