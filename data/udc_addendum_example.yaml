# Example UDC Addendum File
# This file contains local additions to the UDC classification
# Files should be named: udc_addendum_*.yaml
# IMPORTANT: Addendums cannot override existing UDC codes

# Example: Adding a new local classification (valid)
- code: "621.3.001"
  title: "Local Electronics Classification"
  children:
    - code: "621.3.001.1"
      title: "Custom Circuit Design"
    - code: "621.3.001.2"
      title: "Specialized Components"

# Example: Adding completely new local classifications (valid)
- code: "999.1"
  title: "Local Company Classifications"
  children:
    - code: "999.1.1"
      title: "Proprietary Equipment"
    - code: "999.1.2"
      title: "Custom Processes"

# Example: Adding children to existing classifications (valid)
# Note: This creates new codes under existing ones
- code: "621.3.LOCAL"
  title: "Local Electrical Engineering Topics"
  children:
    - code: "621.3.LOCAL.1"
      title: "Company-Specific Electrical Systems"
    - code: "621.3.LOCAL.2"
      title: "Custom Electrical Components"

# INVALID EXAMPLES (would cause errors):
# - code: "004"  # This would overlap with existing UDC code
# - code: "621.3"  # This would overlap with existing UDC code
